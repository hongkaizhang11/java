1. Consider the following code snippet.

```java
arrayOfInts[j] > arrayOfInts[j+1]
```

Which operators does the code contain?
	
	+,>

2. Consider the following code snippet.

```java
int i = 10;
int n = i++%5;
```

What are the values of i and n after the code is executed?

	n == 0 and i == 11
What are the final values of i and n if instead of using the postfix increment operator (i++), you 

	n == 1 and i == 11
use the prefix version (++i))?

3. To invert the value of a boolean, which operator would you use?
	
	!
4. Which operator is used to compare two values, = or == ?
	
	==
5. Explain the following code sample: result = someCondition ? value1 : value2;

	if some condition is true, then return value1, else return value2
